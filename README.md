### Mean Squared Error (MSE):

MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are close to the actual data points. In this case, an MSE of around 2.91 suggests that on average, the squared differences between the predicted sales values and the actual sales values are relatively low.
MSE is sensitive to outliers, so if there are any large deviations in the test data, this could increase the MSE.
### R-squared (R²) Value:

The R² value represents the proportion of variance in the target variable (Sales) that is explained by the model.
An R² value of 0.906 indicates that 90.6% of the variance in sales can be explained by the advertising expenditures on TV, radio, and newspapers. This is a high R² value, suggesting that your model provides a good fit to the data.
However, while a high R² value implies that the model captures a significant amount of the variance, it does not necessarily mean that the model is perfect. Checking residuals, model assumptions, and potential overfitting is essential for further evaluation.
### Model Interpretation:

The features 'TV,' 'Radio,' and 'Newspaper' seem to explain a substantial portion of the variability in sales, making this linear regression model relatively effective.
Further improvements might include exploring feature engineering, regularization, or checking for interactions between predictors.
